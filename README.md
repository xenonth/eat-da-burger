Application does not work or run, I really wanted to get it to work but the frustration of errors and reworking everything from scratch whilst also having a major procject I decided to leave it as is.

The MYSQL sysntax is not working due to me constructing it wrong to begin with,

502 errors and timeouts and the names of the input bar not being taken,

the update function not working and because I am new to this style of coding trying to solve each issue is stressing me out and for my own sanity I have decided to leave it like this at this point in time.  I know its not good practice to leave a fully functioning applciation unfinished but I really do not care about this project anymore to put the how long it will take to get it working.  

I enjoyed the challenge that this project provided and believe I learned what it teaches about the MVC concept.
